# Temperature-monitoring-system-with-WIFI-and-FAN-CONTROL-
# üåêüìå Introduction
The temperature monitoring system with Wi-Fi and fan control is designed to monitor the environment's temperature and control a fan based on the readings. The system uses an ESP32 microcontroller, a DHT22 temperature and humidity sensor, a 16x2 LCD display, and LEDs to indicate the status. The system helps in creating a simple automation setup for fan control based on real-time temperature monitoring.

# APPARATUS USED 
| **Component**        | **Description**                                                                             |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ESP32**            | A powerful microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi capability, used for controlling the system. |
| **DHT22**            | A temperature and humidity sensor used to monitor the environment.                          |
| **16x2 LCD Display** | A Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) to show the temperature and humidity readings.               |
| **Red LED**          | A visual indicator to show when the temperature is above a certain threshold (fan ON).      |
| **Green LED**        | A visual indicator to show when the temperature is within the acceptable range (fan OFF).   |
| **Resistors**        | Used with the LEDs to limit current and prevent damage.                                     |
| **Jumper Wires**     | Wires used for connecting components on the breadboard.                                     |
| **Breadboard**       | A platform for connecting all the components together without soldering.                    |
